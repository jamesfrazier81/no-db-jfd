			<h2>It's time to represent</h2>
			<p>Websites are the first impression made with your online demographics. Put yourself in your customers' shoes - what's the first thing you do after hearing about a product or service you are interested in? Maybe refer to Yelp! or maybe even a social media page? But where do you ultimately end up? Their website! We've all seen the shady-looking site. We ask ouselves:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is this a real company?</li>
				<li>Are they trustworthy?</li>
				<li>If they won't invest in their own site, why should I buy from them?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Make sure your website has relevant and <strong>engaging content</strong> combined with a <strong>killer design</strong>.</p>

			<h2>A Database Solution</h2>

			<ul>
				<li>All content types (text, images, PDFs, etc.) are easily-managed.</li>
				<li>Create various user access permissions.</li>
				<li>Very extendable using plugins and pre-built themes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Each website is customized specifically to each client. Each design includes all applicable brand guidelines including colors, fonts and imagery.</p>

			<h2>A Static Solution</h2>
			<p>Using static HTML to build your site has many benefits including faster load times, no database dependancy and enhanced security. This solution is recommended for clients with minimal HTML and CSS experience.</p>
			<p>With <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML5</a>, you nearly eliminate monthly security updates, giving you more time to make additions to your content. Using standard HTML5 will future-proof your code/site for years to come!</p>
