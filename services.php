			<h2>The Virtual Handshake</h2>
			<p>Websites are the first impression made with your online demographics. Put yourself in your customers' shoes. What is the first thing you do after hearing about a product or service you are interested in? Maybe refer to <em>Yelp!</em> or maybe even a social media page? But where do you ultimately end up? Their website!</p>
			<p>We've all seen the shady-looking, out-of-date site. We ask ouselves:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is this a real company?</li>
				<li>Are they still in business?</li>
				<li>If they won't invest in their own site, should I trust them?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Make sure your website has relevant, engaging content combined with a modern design.</p>

			<h2>HTML5: A Static Solution</h2>
			<p>Using static HTML to build your site has many benefits including faster load times, no database dependancy and enhanced security. This solution is recommended for clients with minimal HTML and CSS experience.</p>
			<p>With <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp" target="_blank">HTML5</a>, you nearly eliminate monthly security updates, giving you more time to make additions to your content. Using standard HTML5 will future-proof your code/site for years to come!</p>
